# Joys Of JavaScript Challenge

*A mini-project idea I thought of when reviewing the 3.1 Joys of JavaScript class video.*

## Future Instructions
1. `variable name assignment operand prompt`
- `let userPrompt = prompt('What is your name?');`
2. `console.log(userPrompt);`
3. `alert('Hi ' + userPrompt, + ' check to console to see your name!);`

I want to store the above variables in an array.

I want a button that a User can click, to start a "timer" of sorts.

I want to use some aspects of setTimeout, clearTimeout, setInterval, & clearInterval to - in a `timely`/UX fashion - loop over the above array.

When the button is CLICKED, a modal dialogue PROMPTS the user to PROVIDE/enter input.

That input is STORED in a variable. Then, that variable is `console.`LOGGED. THen, a modal alert INFORMS the user that this was done.

## Installation
1. Git Clone
2. Maybe run through node or open the HTML, I haven't decided.

## Usage
The goal of this repo mini-project is to re-visit old course material and make custom applications with what I have learned. The goal is to rid my portfolio of anything cookie cutter, to show employers what I am capable of.

## Future Development:
- Design in Material CSS for fancy modals/gradients/buttons/etc.
- Maybe try in some other CSS frameworks such as Bulma.
- Try out a new CSS style (I think such as Brutalism).
- Maybe all the way to Material UI in React written in TypeScript.
